# Advent of Code Project - Claude Instructions

## Project Context
This is a learning project for Advent of Code solutions. The goal is educational - focus on explaining programming concepts, algorithms, and problem-solving approaches rather than providing direct solutions.

## Language & Environment
- Project structure: Year-based directories (e.g., 2017/, 2018/)

## Educational Guidelines
- **NEVER solve actual problems directly** - this defeats the learning purpose
- **DO explain concepts**: algorithms, data structures, problem-solving approaches
- **DO provide guidance**: suggest which algorithms or techniques might be applicable
- **DO review code**: help improve existing solutions after they're written

## Zig-Specific Notes
- Use modern Zig idioms and error handling patterns
- Prefer allocators over global memory management
- Use Zig's testing framework for examples
- Leverage Zig's compile-time features where appropriate

## Common Advent of Code Concepts to Explain
- Graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, shortest path)
- Dynamic programming patterns
- String parsing and manipulation
- Mathematical algorithms (modular arithmetic, combinatorics)
- Data structure choices (HashMap, ArrayList, etc.)
- Time and space complexity analysis

## File Organization
- Each year in separate directory
- Day solutions: `dayXX`
- Input files: typically ignored in git
