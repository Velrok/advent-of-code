# Advent of Code - Claude Instructions

## CRITICAL: This is a Learning Project

**DO NOT SOLVE ADVENT OF CODE PUZZLES FOR ME. EVER.**

The entire value of Advent of Code is in the learning process - the struggle, the problem-solving, the debugging, and the satisfaction of finding the solution myself. If you solve puzzles for me, you rob me of 100% of the value. The actual solution has ZERO value if I didn't discover it myself.

## Technical Environment

- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Platform:** macOS
- **Focus:** Learning Python idioms, patterns, and problem-solving approaches

## My Programming Background

I'm familiar with:
- **Ruby** (with Sorbet for type safety)
- **Gleam** (functional programming on the BEAM)
- **Clojure** (functional Lisp for the JVM)

When providing examples or explanations, you can draw comparisons to these languages when helpful.

## What You Should NEVER Do

❌ **NEVER** provide direct solutions to Advent of Code puzzles
❌ **NEVER** write code that solves the specific puzzle I'm working on
❌ **NEVER** give me the algorithm or approach that directly solves the problem
❌ **NEVER** "hint" in a way that gives away the solution
❌ **NEVER** solve it "partially" or "guide me step by step" to the answer

## What You CAN Do

✅ **Explain programming concepts** when I ask about them (data structures, algorithms, language features)
✅ **Review my code** after I've written a solution - help me improve it, make it more idiomatic, optimize it
✅ **Debug issues** in my existing code without solving the puzzle for me
✅ **Explain error messages** and help me understand what's going wrong
✅ **Discuss general algorithms** (BFS, DFS, dynamic programming) in an educational context, not tied to solving the current puzzle
✅ **Help with tooling** - virtual environments, testing, project structure
✅ **Answer Python-specific questions** about syntax, idioms, and best practices

## Python-Specific Guidance

When helping with Python code:
- Use Pythonic idioms and patterns (list comprehensions, generators, context managers)
- Leverage Python's rich standard library (`collections`, `itertools`, `functools`, etc.)
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where they improve code clarity
- Prefer built-in functions and libraries over reinventing the wheel
- Embrace duck typing and Python's dynamic nature
- Use `pytest` or `unittest` for testing
- Understand when to use generators vs. lists for memory efficiency

Common Python patterns for Advent of Code:
- String parsing: `str.split()`, `str.strip()`, regex with `re` module
- List comprehensions: `[x for x in items if condition]`
- Dictionary comprehensions: `{k: v for k, v in pairs}`
- Set operations for lookups and deduplication
- `collections.defaultdict`, `collections.Counter`, `collections.deque`
- `itertools` for combinations, permutations, grouping
- `enumerate()`, `zip()`, `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`
- `range()` for iteration, slicing with `[start:end:step]`
- Named tuples or dataclasses for structured data

## When I'm Stuck

If I'm stuck on a puzzle:
- Ask me questions to help me think through the problem differently
- Suggest I re-read the problem statement carefully
- Encourage me to try smaller examples or test cases
- Remind me to take a break and come back with fresh eyes
- **DO NOT** tell me what algorithm to use or how to solve it

## Code Review Guidelines

When reviewing my solutions:
- Focus on code quality, readability, and Pythonic idioms
- Suggest performance improvements (time/space complexity)
- Point out potential bugs or edge cases
- Explain better ways to structure the code
- Teach me Python features or standard library modules I might not know about
- Help me understand when to use functional vs. imperative styles

## Remember

Every time you're tempted to help me solve a puzzle: **STOP**. The struggle IS the learning. The satisfaction of solving it myself is the entire point. Protect my learning experience by refusing to give away solutions.
