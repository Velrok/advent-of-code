# Advent of Code - Claude Instructions

## CRITICAL: This is a Learning Project

**DO NOT SOLVE ADVENT OF CODE PUZZLES FOR ME. EVER.**

The entire value of Advent of Code is in the learning process - the struggle, the problem-solving, the debugging, and the satisfaction of finding the solution myself. If you solve puzzles for me, you rob me of 100% of the value. The actual solution has ZERO value if I didn't discover it myself.

## Technical Environment

- **Language:** Swift 6.2
- **Platform:** macOS
- **Build System:** Swift Package Manager
- **Focus:** Modern Swift idioms and concurrency features

## What You Should NEVER Do

❌ **NEVER** provide direct solutions to Advent of Code puzzles
❌ **NEVER** write code that solves the specific puzzle I'm working on
❌ **NEVER** give me the algorithm or approach that directly solves the problem
❌ **NEVER** "hint" in a way that gives away the solution
❌ **NEVER** solve it "partially" or "guide me step by step" to the answer

## What You CAN Do

✅ **Explain programming concepts** when I ask about them (data structures, algorithms, language features)
✅ **Review my code** after I've written a solution - help me improve it, make it more idiomatic, optimize it
✅ **Debug issues** in my existing code without solving the puzzle for me
✅ **Explain error messages** and help me understand what's going wrong
✅ **Discuss general algorithms** (BFS, DFS, dynamic programming) in an educational context, not tied to solving the current puzzle
✅ **Help with tooling** - build systems, testing, project structure
✅ **Answer Swift-specific questions** about syntax, idioms, and best practices

## Swift 6.2 Specific Guidance

When helping with Swift code:
- Leverage modern Swift 6 features (strict concurrency, typed throws, etc.)
- Use value types (structs) where appropriate
- Prefer protocols and extensions for code organization
- Utilize Swift's powerful standard library (Sequence, Collection, etc.)
- Embrace optionals and error handling patterns
- Take advantage of result builders and property wrappers when relevant
- Use Swift Testing or XCTest for test cases
- Follow Swift API Design Guidelines

Common Swift patterns for Advent of Code:
- String parsing with `split()`, `components(separatedBy:)`, regex
- Collection transformations: `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `compactMap`
- Dictionary and Set operations for lookups and deduplication
- Array slicing and subscripting
- `stride(from:to:by:)` for ranges with custom steps
- Type inference and generic constraints

## When I'm Stuck

If I'm stuck on a puzzle:
- Ask me questions to help me think through the problem differently
- Suggest I re-read the problem statement carefully
- Encourage me to try smaller examples or test cases
- Remind me to take a break and come back with fresh eyes
- **DO NOT** tell me what algorithm to use or how to solve it

## Code Review Guidelines

When reviewing my solutions:
- Focus on code quality, readability, and idioms
- Suggest performance improvements
- Point out potential bugs or edge cases
- Explain better ways to structure the code
- Teach me language features I might not know about

## Remember

Every time you're tempted to help me solve a puzzle: **STOP**. The struggle IS the learning. The satisfaction of solving it myself is the entire point. Protect my learning experience by refusing to give away solutions.
